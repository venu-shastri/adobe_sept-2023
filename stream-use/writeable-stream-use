1.We first write the head of the HTTP response. Note that writeHead() is not
a part of the Writable interface; in fact, it's an auxiliary method exposed by
the http.ServerResponse class.
2. We start a loop that terminates with a likelihood of five percent (we instruct
chance.bool() to return true for 95 percent of the time).
3. Inside the loop, we write a random string into the stream.
4. Once we are out of the loop, we call end() on the stream, indicating that no
more data will be written. Also, we provide a final string to be written into
the stream before ending it.
5. Finally, we register a listener for the finish event, which will be fired when
all the data has been flushed into the underlying socket.
